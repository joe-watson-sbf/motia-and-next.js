    "description": "Unlock hidden $50K in your business with AI strategies at our online Opportunity Mapping Workshop!\nThe $50K Hiding in Your Business\nYou know AI is supposed to help your business. But between the hype and the tools, you're not sure where to start - or if it's even worth it.\n\nHere's what you're tired of:\n- Paying staff to do the same repetitive tasks over and over\n- Errors and rework eating into your margins\n- Customers frustrated by slow response times\n- Knowing there's a better way but not seeing it clearly\n\nWhat if you could identify exactly where $50,000-$200,000 is hiding in your business - in 90 minutes?\n\nWhat You'll Walk Away With:\n\n✓ A completed 1-page framework mapping your highest-ROI AI opportunities\n✓ Dollar amounts attached to each opportunity (actual savings, not guesses)\n✓ Your Top 3 prioritized opportunities ranked by quick-win potential\n✓ First action steps you can take Monday morning (no tools required)\n✓ Canadian compliance checklist (critical for Quebec businesses)\n\nThis Workshop is For You If:\n\n- You run a business with repetitive processes (admin, customer service, scheduling, document creation)\n- You're in healthcare, legal, finance, or professional services (compliance matters)\n- You've tried AI tools but haven't seen real ROI yet\n- You want to understand opportunities BEFORE buying expensive tools\n- You're skeptical of AI hype but open to evidence-based opportunities\n\nWhat Makes This Different:\n\nNot a sales pitch. You're not walking into a 90-minute tool demo. You're doing real work on YOUR business.\n\nNot generic advice. You'll complete an actual framework with real numbers from your operations.\n\nNot theory. This is the same framework I use with clients who've implemented AI solutions saving $45K-$150K annually.\n\nYour Instructor:\n\nDenis Daigle - Tech Strategy Partner & Founder, DenisDaigle.com\n\n- 25+ years in B2B SaaS technology\n- 7 years as CTO of B2B SaaS company\n- Expert in Canadian data compliance (PIPEDA, Law 25)\n- Specializes in ROI-focused AI implementations for health, finance, paralegal businesses\n\nDenis helps businesses find where AI/Tech creates real value - not just where it's interesting.\n\nWorkshop Structure (90 minutes):\n\nPart 1: The Real AI Opportunity (20 min)\n- Why most AI projects fail (and how to avoid it)\n- The 3 types of AI opportunities in every business\n- Real case study: 15-20 of staff hours a week for an Occupational Therapist firm owner\n\nPart 2: Live Mapping Exercise (45 min)\n- Identify your high-volume processes\n- Calculate hidden costs (errors, rework, friction)\n- Score AI opportunity potential\n- Prioritize your Top 3 opportunities\n- Compliance check for Canadian regulations\n\nPart 3: From Insight to Action (25 min)\n- First steps for Monday morning\n- DIY vs. professional implementation\n- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc)\n- Q&A\n\nWhat You'll Need:\n\nJust bring:\n- A calculator (or phone)\n- Basic knowledge of your business processes\n- An open mind\n\nWe provide:\n- Framework templates\n- Worksheets and guides\n- Post-workshop resources\n\nSpace is Limited\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a webinar. Limited to 150 attendees to ensure everyone gets individual attention.\n\nCost: FREE\n\nWhy free? Because too many Quebec businesses are spending money on AI tools before understanding where the opportunities are. This workshop fixes that.\n\nReady to Find Your $50K?\n\nClick \"Register\" to secure your spot.\n\nQuestions? Email denis@denisdaigle.com\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Workshop conducted in English\n- No recording will be provided for the\n- Watch on a laptop/tablet if you prefer digital note-taking (optional)\n- PDF framework template provided to all attendees\n\nKeep Your Data Canadian\n\nAll AI implementation strategies discussed comply with Canadian data sovereignty requirements, strategies are equally applicable to US, and other parts of the world.
